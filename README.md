## About
Embark on a journey through the nuanced dimensions of suicide rates. Our comprehensive research spans geographical, age-related, yearly, 
GDP per capita, and population-based analyses, unraveling intricate patterns from 1985 to 2020. Explore the various factors that influence suicide rates, 
such as the impact of suicide prevention and support organizations, geographical variations, the interplay of age groups and generational factors, and make 
insightful comparisons with other leading causes of death.

### Research Goals

1) To investigate the intricate interplay between geographical variations in suicide rates and age-related patterns, aiming to understand the contributing factors and
provide comprehensive insights for the development of targeted suicide prevention strategies.

2) To conduct a comparative analysis of suicide rates across countries and years, specifically focusing on gender differences. The primary objective is to create two pie
charts that visually represent the distribution of female and male suicides, providing insights into gender-specific patterns and variations over time and between nations.

3) To investigate and analyze the correlation between GDP per capita and suicide rates across diverse countries, aiming to discern patterns and relationships that can contribute
to a nuanced understanding of the economic factors influencing suicide rates on a global scale.
   
4) To examine the relationship between the availability of health facilities and the incidence of suicide in Canada, with the objective of determining whether the number of health facilities has an impact on the total number of suicides.
